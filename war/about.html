	<h1>Rules of Klondike Solitaire</h1>
	<img src="rules_illustration.png">
	<p>A standard deck of 52 playing cards is shuffled. Cards are dealt onto the
		'tableaux', an arrangement of seven columns on the bottom half of the playing area. In
		each tableau an increasing number of cards is placed from one to seven. All but the
		bottom card are dealt face down. The bottom card is dealt face up.</p>
	<p>The remaining cards are placed face down in the top left of the playing area. This
		is the 'stock'.</p>
	<p>At any time the player can deal (depending on settings) one or three cards (facing them up) from the stock to a
		'waste' pile to the right of the stock. If there are just one or two cards remaining in the
		stock all the remaining cards can be dealt to the stock. If there are no cards in the
		stock the player can take all the waste cards and return them, face down, to the stock
		area.</p>
	<p>The objective of the game is to move all of the cards to the 'foundations', four slots for
  cards on the top right of the playing area. The player may move any ace card from the top of the
  waste or the bottom of any of the tableau columns onto any empty foundation slot. When a
  foundation slot is occupied, the player may move any single card (from the top of the waste or
  bottom of the tableau) onto a foundation, provided it is the same suit and one higher in value
  than the top occupying card.</p>
	<p>The player may also move certain cards onto the tableaux. The criteria is that the
		moved card must be of opposite color suit and exactly one fewer value of the bottom card of
		the tableau column moved onto. The cards that can be moved are any single card that meets
		the criteria from the waste or top of a foundation; or any single card or group of cards
		taken from the bottom of a tableau where the top card of the group meets the criteria.</p>
